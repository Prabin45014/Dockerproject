    <body><h1>My Docker Project</h1>
        <p>This is my first docker project. I just create a simple index.html file. 
        I used an index.html file for my GitHub repository. From GitHub my repository, 
        I pull my index.html file and create one docker image. index.html docker image pushes into my docker hub.
        Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. 
        Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software
        needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Prabin Sharma Some Changes in Code.
